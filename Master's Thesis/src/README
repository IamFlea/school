This folder contains really big mess, in czech folk terms brothel.
Here are scripts which were used in the thesis and I doubt that some of them will be used!
Except the script called circuit.py in which is a class for circuits in chromosome format. The script analyses them and gives us the information of the circuit.

The filename describes what it does...
adder_generator.py      -- Generates speccification of the adders
adder_run.sh            -- Batch approximation of the adder
benchmark_test.sh       -- Analysis of time spend in each function of CGP
circuit.py              -- The best script, it analyses the soltuions of CGP
getdata.py              -- Some other analysis script (an example how to not write comments)
gimmeh_the_best_circuit.py -- selecting the best circuit
get_best_adders.py      -- from N runs of approximations give us the best solution and it yields (for adders) 
get_best_circuit.py     -- from N runs of approximations give us the best solution and it yields (for multipliers)
kogge_stone.py          -- designs kogge stone adders
mult_run.sh             -- Batch approximation for multiplier
multiplier_generator.py -- generates the specification of the multipliers
random_seeds_100        -- 100 random numbers used in this thesis for the run
randomorg.sh            -- generates 100 random numbers
remove_gate.py          -- remove the gate from multiplier
remove_gate_adder.py    -- remove the gate from adder; has a bug!!
test_fitness_sad.sh     -- batch run of SAD
test_fitness_shd.sh     -- batch run of SHD
test_fitness_wshd.sh    -- batch run of WSHD
wallace_tree.py         -- design of the multiplier by Wallace tree
check_nasobicky.py -- testing the multiplier
check_scitack.py   -- testing the adder
create_dotplots.py -- create dot plots 
edges.py           -- batch run for edge detection
make_graphs.py     -- plots the graphs
etc.


How to solve the problem with the mess:
1. Find a good wife that can work with PC and who knows czech language.
   $ wget woman
   Some males needs to rewrite her:
   $ vim woman.cpp
   $ gcc woman.cpp -o woman

2. Tell her to clean this folder
   $ woman clean /src/

3. For the correct functionality, woman has to be run with different commands than the run "clean". Here are the examples:
   $ woman giveher < "<3"
   $ woman giveher < ./roses
   $ woman giveher < `myself /dev/cook dinner`
   ...
   However the list is not enumerable by Turing machine.

4. I helped a woman by writing this file. :)

5. My jokes suck.
